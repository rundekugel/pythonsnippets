Experiments with Global Variables in Python

Start file modul1.py to see diffenrent methods, how to deal with global variables in big projects, spread over multiple files.

"globalsContainer.py" shows:

 - how to store info in a module with predefined variable
 
"globalsContainerSimple.py" shows, this is also possible in a empty module, but variable must be inited before use and you don't have an overview over all global vars.
